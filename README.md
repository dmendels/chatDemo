# iOS Chat room demo with Parse.com server side #

This project was set up as a complete source for the tutorial entitled: "iOS Tutorial: Creating a chat room using Parse.com" that can be found on my [personal blog](http://attila.tumblr.com). Here's a view of what is created:

The project uses iOS5 and StoryBoards, it was created with the latest version of Xcode (4.3.1). In order to make the project generic, I implemented a tab view controller, so the chat room view controller can be ported easily to other apps. The skin of the chatRoom is _very_ basic: just an image background. I'll try to find some time to add the chat bubbles at some point.

In order to make things clear and have the project runnable upon download, I left some (my) working ApplicationID and clientKey in the AppDelegate. Please do not abuse it, or I'll be forced to revoke the keys not nice to beginners, but it's really easy to obtain your own.
